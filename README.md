</p>

**Description:**

This repository host all the notebooks that I wrote during the time I participate in Diver's machine learning course. Which includes:

- Basic ML concepts
- Data analysis
- Re-implementation of most ML methods
- Re-implementation of some Neural Network models
- Re-implementation of some Neural network structures

Final graduation project is a separate repo that can be found [here](https://github.com/produdez/poe-economy)

## Setup

Requirements and Installations:

1. Python
2. Some notebooks require specific Python libraries so be warned!

## Usage

1. Just clone this repository
2. And run the notebooks
3. [Note] (some notebook need dataset) that's not available here.
